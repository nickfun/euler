Code that I use to solve [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) problems.

Tools
-----

The problems will be solved in C or C++, unless it requires the manipulation of number that the C/C++ builtin types can not handle. In that situation I will use python. I might go back later and solve those again with the [GMP library](http://gmplib.org/), but for now I just want to get in there and solve some problems.

I am developing this on my Ubuntu 12.10 Desktop using Sublime 2 for writing the code

About Me
--------

I am [Nick](http://www.nick.gs/), a software engineer. A lot of code I write usually has to do with databases and user interfaces. For me, solving problems at Project Euler lets me get back into the more abstract, academic uses of computer programming.
